I coded this whole thing with AI using Chat GPT premium ayyy!! 
Put your Chat Gpt API key and Discord Bot Token in the .env file 
Chat GPT API: (platform.openai.com)
The main.py file is tailored to MY discord server's needs you can change the prompt to fit your needs
Should be pretty straight forward; if you have issues ask chat gpt that's what i did frfr
