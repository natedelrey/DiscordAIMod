I coded this whole thing with AI using Chat GPT premium ayyy!! 
Put your Chat GPT API key and Discord Bot Token in the .env file 
Chat GPT API: (platform.openai.com)
The main.py file is tailored to MY discord server's needs You can change the prompt to fit your needs
Should be pretty straightforward; if you have issues ,ask Chat GPT that's what I did frfr
